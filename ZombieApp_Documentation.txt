ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE APPLICATION
==============================
By: Helen Totterdell


This application takes in 3 inputs:

Probability of Zombie Bite - Takes a value from (0,1) as the initial proportion of zombies
in the population on Day 1.  This probability will update in the machinery as more of the
population becomes zombies.

Probability of Death from Zombie Bite - Takes a value from (0,1) as the probability of 
dying from a zombie bite when in contact with a zombie.  Alternative to death in this
simulation is becoming a zombie.

Population Size - The initial population size (humans and zombies) at Day 1.

From these inputs a graph is produced of daily population stats (the proportion of
humans alive and the proportion of zombies) using the initial population as the
denominator.
